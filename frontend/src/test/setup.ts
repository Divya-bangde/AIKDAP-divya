 * storytelling is built on (Sprint 9K.4).
 *
 * The stub reports every observed element as intersecting, so tests see
 * the page in its scrolled-through state. That is the right default
 * here: what these tests must protect is that the *content* is present
 * and readable, and content whose only path to being shown is an
 * animation firing would be a genuine defect. If a section ever failed
 * to render because its reveal never ran, a test asserting on its text
 * would catch it. */
