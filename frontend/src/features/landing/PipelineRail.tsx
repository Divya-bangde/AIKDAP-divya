/**
 * The scroll-driven spine of the entry experience.
 *
 * A single line runs down the left of the stage list and draws itself
 * as the reader scrolls through the section — so descending the page
 * *is* descending the pipeline. This is the one place on the landing
 * page where animation is bound to scroll position rather than to a
 * viewport crossing, because it is the one place where the reader's
 * progress and the content's progress are the same thing.
 *
 * Scroll is never hijacked. The page scrolls at exactly its normal
 * rate; only the line's length is derived from how far through the
 * section the reader has travelled. Every stage's text is present and
 * readable regardless of the line's state — if the animation never ran
 * at all, nothing would be lost but the effect.
 *
 * The stages are the real processing stages of the platform, named as
 * the backend names them. This is a description of the architecture,
 * not a readout of anything happening now.
