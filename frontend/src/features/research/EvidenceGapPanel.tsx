/** Surfaces the real reason a run declined to answer, at the exact
 * moment a reader hits that wall (Sprint 16 Phase 8.11 Part C).
 *
 * `analysis.py`'s gap classification (`ResearchGap`,
 * `sufficiency`/`sufficiency_reason`) already existed and was already
 * correct -- Phase 8.2 proved it against a real paper -- but nothing
 * in the UI ever rendered it. This does not compute a new verdict: it
 * calls the same `/documents/{asset_id}/analyze` endpoint
 * `DocumentAnalysisPanel` already calls manually, automatically, using
 * the run's own query as the goal, and renders exactly what comes
 * back. No gap text is invented here -- an item with no
 * `missing_information` renders no gap list at all, and the
 * `EmptyState`/upload action is the honest fallback while the check is
 * still running or found nothing to name.
 *
 * Scoped to the project's first asset: every real project in this
 * deployment has exactly one source paper, and `analyze` is a
 * per-asset endpoint with no run-level equivalent to call instead.
 *
 * Below the gap list, also offers the one deliberate way out of the
 * evidence boundary (Sprint 16 Phase 8.13): pressing the control here
 * is a second, explicit action after the refusal has already
 * rendered -- it never fires automatically, and the resulting
 * `unsourced` run is a separate row the backend creates via
 * `POST /research/runs/{run_id}/unsourced`, never a rewrite of this
 * one's `insufficient_evidence` verdict.
