/** Plain-language labels for the pipeline's real stages (Sprint 9K.8).
 *
 * The backend's own step titles are accurate but written for someone
 * who already knows the architecture ("Route to retrieval agents",
 * "Build the working context"). An executive watching a run doesn't
 * need to know an agent was routed — they need to know AIKDAP is
 * figuring out where to look.
 *
 * This maps the six real `node_name` values a run actually produces —
 * confirmed against `backend/app/agents/planner/nodes.py`, not
 * guessed — to static, plain-language copy. It is deliberately static:
 * these describe what a stage of this *kind* always does, not a
 * measurement of this run. That is why they read like the landing
 * page's own explanatory copy rather than like `step.summary` (which
 * IS a real, run-specific measurement and remains available, verbatim,
 * in the technical detail view).
 *
 * Nothing here invents a stage the backend doesn't have. There is no
 * seventh "Checking Grounding" entry: grounding verification is real,
 * but it happens *inside* synthesis (every citation the model returns
 * is checked against the evidence actually supplied to it) rather than
 * as its own backend step — so that fact is folded into synthesis's
 * own description instead of being presented as a stage with its own
 * status and timing it does not really have. */

 * it was written out twice as a bare `grounding_status === "grounded"`,
 * the last remaining pair of hand-rolled research-outcome semantics in

 * the rule one home alongside `runOutcome`.
 *
 * Two things it deliberately does NOT do:

 * 1. It never counts a run because `status === "completed"`. A
 *    completed run that could not ground an answer is not a grounded
 *    answer, which is the distinction this whole product exists to
 *    make.
 * 2. It excludes `partially_grounded`. That state means the model
 *    returned at least one valid citation *and* some citation ids that
 *    were never supplied to it (those were rejected). Counting it here
 *    would inflate a headline number the tile captions "Backed by
 *    cited evidence" — the conservative reading is the honest one. */
