/** `ResearchRunDetail.citations` is typed as `Record<string, unknown>[]`
 * in the generated OpenAPI types (`src/types/api.d.ts`) — the backend
 * stores citations as JSONB with no strict Pydantic sub-schema, so
 * `openapi-typescript` cannot generate a stricter shape.
 *
 * This is the one hand-written UI type the design spec allows for
 * exactly that reason. Every field is optional and every read site
 * must use it that way: this describes what the backend has been
 * observed to send, not a contract it promises to send. Never assume
 * a field is present — render "Not provided" rather than a fabricated
 * value when it's missing (Phase 20/24: "only show fields actually
 * returned by the API", "do not invent fields").
