/** AIKDAP's motion vocabulary (Sprint 9K.2).
 *
 * Every animation in the product is composed from the variants below
 * rather than defined inline, so timing and easing stay consistent and
 * a change to the product's "feel" happens in one file.
 *
 * The rules this encodes:
 *
 * 1. **Motion communicates state, not decoration.** Entrances
 *    establish hierarchy (what arrived, in what order); transitions
 *    show continuity (this card became this page); status animation
 *    reflects what the backend actually reports.
 * 2. **Transform and opacity only.** Both are compositor-friendly, so
 *    animation never triggers layout and never costs a reflow.
 * 3. **Fast enough to feel responsive.** Nothing decorative runs
 *    longer than `duration.slow`; navigation is never gated on an
 *    animation finishing.
 * 4. **Distance is small.** 8–16px of travel reads as intentional;
 *    large movement reads as a template.
 *
 * Reduced motion is handled globally by `<MotionConfig reducedMotion="user">`
 * in `App.tsx`, which strips transform/layout animation for users who
 * ask for it while leaving opacity — so content still appears, it just
 * doesn't travel. CSS-driven decoration is disabled separately in
 * `index.css`. */

 *
 * Two deliberate choices:
 *
 * 1. **Enter is opacity-only.** The pages themselves already rise 8px
 *    via `pageEnter`. Adding travel here too would compound into ~18px
 *    of movement, past the 16px this system allows, and read as a
 *    slide. The shell supplies the departure the pages never had; the
 *    pages supply the arrival.
 * 2. **Short, and shorter on the way out.** Leaving is not information,
 *    so it gets 160ms. Navigation is never gated on either.
 *
 * Applied inside a `sync`-mode `AnimatePresence`, so the outgoing and
 * incoming pages are briefly mounted together — which is what allows a
 * `layoutId` element (a project card becoming a workspace header) to
 * animate between them. `mode="wait"` would unmount the source before
