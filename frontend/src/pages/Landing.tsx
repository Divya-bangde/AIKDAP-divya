 * payload contains the screen a visitor is actually waiting for, and

 * AIKDAP's public entry experience.
 *
 * **Always dark** (Sprint 9K.3, Phase 16), regardless of the user's
 * saved application theme: `useForcedTheme` pins the document while
 * this page is mounted and restores their real preference on unmount,
 * without ever writing to it. A user who prefers light sees a dark
 * landing and a light workspace — that contrast is the intent.
 *
 * The page is a scrolling document of nine sections that walks through
 * the platform's real pipeline in the order the pipeline runs, so
 * descending the page and descending the architecture are the same
 * movement (Sprint 9K.4).
 *
 * Everything on it is explanatory. The components, models and stages
 * named here exist and are named as the codebase names them, but no
 * number, status or measurement on this page is read from a running
 * system — and the two figures that could be mistaken for measurements
 * say so in their own captions.
