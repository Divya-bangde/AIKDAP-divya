"""Shared pytest fixtures.

The integration tests here run against the real Postgres instance the
application uses, not a mock: the bug under test was a data-propagation
failure that only shows up once state has actually been persisted, so
verifying it against an in-memory double would prove nothing.

Every fixture cleans up after itself — the user cascade removes the
project, runs, steps, and messages it created.
