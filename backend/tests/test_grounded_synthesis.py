"""Sprint 9E: grounded RAG synthesis through the AIKDAP LLM gateway.

Every test here is offline and deterministic. Nothing reaches Gemini:
where a model is involved, `litellm.acompletion` itself is replaced, so
the call still travels the *real* gateway (credentials, error mapping,
secret scrubbing, response normalization) and only the network hop is
faked. That is deliberate — a test that stubbed out `LLMGateway`
wholesale would pass just as happily if synthesis had been rewired to
call a provider directly, which is exactly the regression this sprint
must prevent.

The load-bearing assertions are the negative ones: that only retrieved
evidence reaches the model, that a citation id the model invented is
rejected rather than repaired, and that a model failure produces no
answer at all rather than an uncited one.
