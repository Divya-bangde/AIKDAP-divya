"""Sprint 16 Phase 7B.25 -- the REAL Docker execution launcher.

THIS IS THE ONLY MODULE IN THIS APPLICATION PERMITTED TO IMPORT THE
DOCKER SDK. `docker_policy.py`/`translator.py`/`resolvers.py` stay
exactly as pure/I-O-free (policy) or DB-only (resolution) as their own
docstrings already declare -- this module is additive, not a rewrite of
any of them. Nothing here decides POLICY: it trusts `ApprovedLaunchSpec`
completely, translating its already-approved fields into the real
Docker API and driving the lifecycle the Sprint 16 Phase 7B.25 real
Docker spike observed directly (see that spike's notes for every claim
below marked OBSERVED).

Lifecycle (Docker call -> durable persist, in this exact order, each
persist step its own commit -- "durable identity before the next risky
operation," the same discipline every prior execution-module phase in
this sprint has used):

    ExecutionAttempt(PENDING_CREATE)          [already exists]
        -> docker create
        -> persist container_id + status=CREATED
        -> docker start
        -> persist status=RUNNING, started_at (job.status=RUNNING too,
           Sprint 16 Phase 7B.28)
        -> BOUNDED docker wait (`_wait_bounded`, Sprint 16 Phase 7B.28:
           polls in `_POLL_INTERVAL_S` slices, terminates the container
           if `approved.timeout_s` elapses or a durable cancellation
           request is observed -- see that function's own docstring)
        -> inspect (authoritative for Status/ExitCode/FinishedAt --
           OBSERVED: wait()'s own return is `{"StatusCode": N}` only)
        -> persist status=EXITED, exit_code, completed_at (job.status
           becomes exactly one of SUCCEEDED/FAILED/TIMED_OUT/CANCELLED)
        -> collect stdout/stderr (bounded)
        -> persist result via the existing Asset/StorageProvider
           mechanism (a new column on ExecutionAttempt was explicitly
           out of scope this phase; `error_message` keeps its existing,
           narrower meaning -- a short diagnostic -- rather than being
           repurposed to hold full output, which is exactly the kind of
           field-semantic conflation Phase 7B.24 spent a whole slice
           correcting for `input_asset_ids`)
        -> remove container (idempotent: NotFound == already clean,
           OBSERVED)

Docker never raises for a nonzero application exit code (OBSERVED,
spike Test 2) -- `succeeded` below is computed explicitly from
`exit_code == 0 and termination_reason == "natural"`, never inferred
from the absence of an exception.

Sprint 16 Phase 7B.28 closed the "no timeout" gap Phase 7B.26 flagged:
`docker wait()` is never called unbounded any more -- see
`_wait_bounded`'s docstring for the real-daemon evidence behind the
bounded-polling design and why a naive `asyncio.wait_for()` wrapper
would not actually have been safe. Docker-aware crash RECONCILIATION
(orphan discovery, startup scanning) remains out of scope -- Phase
7B.29's job.

    `_classify_termination_from_evidence` -- see that function's own
    docstring for why that reconstruction is honest, not a guess).

    `inspect()` is always re-read here and is authoritative for
    ExitCode/FinishedAt/StartedAt (OBSERVED, Phase 7B.25 spike) -- never
    trusted from an earlier in-memory `wait_result` alone. `wait_result`
    is optional and used only for the diagnostic exit-code-mismatch log
    Phase 7B.25 already had; `reconcile_attempt`'s "container already
    exited, DB hadn't caught up" path has no `wait_result` of its own
    (no wait was ever performed by this process) and passes `None`.

    `ExecutionJobRepository.finalize_running_job`'s atomic conditional
    `UPDATE` (`WHERE status IN ('RUNNING', 'CANCEL_REQUESTED', 'VALIDATING')`)
    is the ONE serialization point in this function: only the caller whose
    call to it actually claims the row (a) treats `succeeded`/`diagnostic`
    as authoritative, (b) is allowed to create a NEW result `Asset` (via
    `_find_or_create_result_asset`) if none exists yet, and (c) removes
    the container. A caller that loses this race -- the normal launcher
    vs. a reconciler, or two concurrent reconcilers, Sprint 16 Phase
    7B.29 races A/B/D -- does none of those three things and returns.

    Cleanup is deliberately gated behind the SAME win/lose branch as log
    collection and asset creation (T9, discovered via a REAL race: two
    concurrent reconcilers both calling `_best_effort_remove` -- even
    though `remove()` itself is independently idempotent -- raced a
    still-in-progress `container.logs()` read on the winner's side into a
    real `docker.errors.APIError(409)` ("removal of container ... is
    already in progress"), observed directly against the daemon before
    this gating was added). Only the winner ever reads logs from or
    removes a given container; the loser touches Docker exactly zero
    times once it has lost, eliminating that race by construction rather
    than by tolerating the 409.

    single unbounded `container.wait()` Phase 7B.25/26/27 used -- a

    start failure, daemon transport failure, or a genuine failure

       timestamps) >= the resource-class-derived `timeout_s` -- the SAME
       comparison `_wait_bounded`'s own deadline check performs, just
       computed after the fact from Docker's own timestamps instead of a
       live monotonic clock.
    3. Otherwise "natural" -- the container exited within its own time
       budget with no cancellation on record.

    Classified as INFERRED evidence (see the phase report), not OBSERVED:

    Docker daemon after the process driving this attempt's lifecycle (a
    `launch_execution_job`/`recover_execution_job_retry` Celery task, or
    an earlier reconciliation attempt) has disappeared, or simply lost the
    race to another such process, without reaching a terminal write.

    Container identity (Sprint 16 Phase 7B.29 "CONTAINER IDENTITY"):
    `attempt.container_id` when present, else the deterministic
    `attempt.container_name` (persisted on every attempt row at creation,
    unlike `container_id`, which is NULL until `docker create()` is
    confirmed). Docker-py's `containers.get()` accepts either a name or an
    ID. Name and ID can never refer to two different attempts: `container_
    name` is a pure function of `attempt_id` alone
    (`app.modules.execution.service.container_name_for_attempt`) AND is
    DB-unique (`ExecutionAttempt.container_name`, `unique=True`) --
    together these mean at most one attempt row could ever have proposed
    a given name to Docker, and Docker itself separately enforces name
    uniqueness within the daemon; `container_id` is likewise DB-unique
    once set. There is structurally no way for this lookup to resolve to
    a container belonging to a different attempt.

    Idempotent by construction, safe under arbitrary concurrent callers
    (T9/T10/T15 -- two reconciliation workers on the same attempt, a live
    launcher racing a reconciler, a timeout/cancel race, repeated runs):
    every branch that WRITES a job's terminal status goes through
    `ExecutionJobRepository.finalize_running_job`'s atomic conditional
    `UPDATE ... WHERE status IN ('RUNNING', 'CANCEL_REQUESTED')`, and
    every branch that creates a result `Asset` does so only after WINNING
    that same atomic claim (`_finalize_exited_attempt`) -- Postgres, not
    application timing, is the sole arbiter of which concurrent caller's
    write actually lands. Docker operations (`kill()`, `remove()`) are
    independently idempotent (OBSERVED, Phase 7B.25/7B.28 spikes:
    `kill()` on an already-dead container raises `APIError(409)`,
    `remove()` on an already-gone one raises `NotFound` -- both handled).

    Never creates a second `ExecutionAttempt`, never touches
    `attempt_number`, never moves a job back to `PENDING`/`VALIDATING`/
    `LAUNCHING`, and never calls `prepare_retry_attempt`/
    `recover_interrupted_retry_attempt` -- this function recovers the
    lifecycle of the EXISTING attempt only, exactly as scoped.

    Returns a `ReconciliationOutcome` whose `action` is one of:
    `attempt_not_found`, `job_not_found`, `daemon_unreachable_deferred`,
    `inspect_failed_deferred`, `pending_create_no_container`,
    `already_terminal_no_container`, `already_terminal_cleaned_up`,
    `lost_marked_unknown`, `recovered_created_abandoned`,

    `terminal_job_leftover_container_terminated`,
    `inconsistent_job_status_preserved`,
    `inconsistent_docker_status_preserved`,

    `*_preserved` outcome deliberately makes NO durable write -- Docker
    daemon failures and unresolvable inconsistencies are left for a later
    reconciliation pass rather than resolved by a guess (Sprint 16 Phase
    7B.29's explicit "distinguish: retry later, mark UNKNOWN, preserve
    current state").
