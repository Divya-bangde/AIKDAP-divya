"""Celery application instance and configuration.

Reads the broker and result-backend URLs from the application
`Settings` object — no hardcoded connection strings — so the worker
process uses exactly the same Redis configuration as the rest of the
app. This module only builds and configures the `Celery` instance;
`worker.py` is the process entry point (logging setup, explicit task
registration, the `-A` target Docker/CLI actually invoke).

# registered on `Base.metadata` — which requires their model modules
# to have been imported *somewhere* in this process. Without this,
# configuring the `Asset` mapper fails with `NoReferencedTableError`
