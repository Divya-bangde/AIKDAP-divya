"""Celery worker process entry point.

This is the `-A` (app) target Docker and the CLI use:

    celery -A app.workers.worker worker --loglevel=info

Responsibilities that belong here rather than in `celery_app.py`:
configuring the app's own structured logging for this process, and
explicitly importing the task modules so `celery -A app.workers.worker
inspect registered` reflects them immediately — `celery_app.py`'s
`autodiscover_tasks` calls already do this lazily on worker startup,
so the imports below are redundant-but-explicit rather than load-bearing,
matching the "explicit is better than implicit" register-tasks
responsibility called out for this module.

`app` is deliberately the name of the re-exported Celery instance:
Celery's `-A` flag looks for an attribute named `app` (or `celery`) in
the target module by convention, and `app = celery_app` is what makes
`-A app.workers.worker` resolve correctly.

    Deliberately a single `asyncio.run()` around all three calls below,

    FIRST one this worker process ever makes, and the very NEXT one is
    `app.workers.tasks._run_task_loop`'s, for whatever real task Celery
    dispatches first -- both this call and every task afterward run
    against the `NullPool`-backed engine `configure_for_worker_process()`

    already established, so there is no pooled `asyncpg` connection
    left behind for a later `asyncio.run()` to incorrectly reuse across
    a now-closed event loop. See `app.database.session.configure_for_
    worker_process`'s own docstring for the full, empirically-confirmed
    story of the bug this closes and why a simpler per-call `engine.
    dispose()` (tried first) was not sufficient on the real worker.

    `reconcile_stale_launching_execution_jobs` (Phase 7B.22) is safe to
    call from this "fast, never-raises" path even though it drives real
    retry recovery, because it only detects and enqueues here -- the
    guard pipeline and the claim transaction run later, inside the
    Celery task it enqueues, off this loop entirely.
