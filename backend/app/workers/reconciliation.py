"""Sprint 9J: recovers `ResearchRun` rows orphaned by a worker
interruption.

`ResearchExecutionService.execute()` sets `status=RUNNING` before doing
any real work and only reaches `_complete()`/`_fail()` if its own
Python process survives long enough to run them (see
`app.modules.research.service`). A worker crash, an OOM kill, or a
container restart mid-run skips both of those, and nothing in the
architecture ever revisits the row afterward -- confirmed live: a run
from an earlier interrupted manual test was still sitting at `RUNNING`
days later, with no active task claiming it.

This module does not run automatically as a cron: like
`app.workers.scheduler`'s existing `retry_failed_tasks`, this project
has no active Celery Beat schedule (`celery_app.py` defines no
`beat_schedule`, and no `beat` service exists in `docker-compose.yml`),
so adding one just for this single lightweight check would be
infrastructure the measurements do not justify. Instead,
`reconcile_stale_research_runs_on_startup()` runs once per worker
process, via Celery's own `worker_ready` signal (wired up in
`app.workers.worker`) -- the same "startup reconciliation" pattern
Sprint 9H already established for the API process
(`app.core.llm.startup_validation.run_startup_validation`, run from
FastAPI's lifespan). A worker that crashed and restarted reconciles its
own orphans the moment it comes back up; a long-lived worker that never
crashes never needs to.

    The gap this closes (Sprint 16 Phase 7B.15): `prepare_approved_launch()`
    commits the attempt row before any Docker call, on purpose, so a

    Nothing revisited those rows -- structurally the same orphan Sprint 9J
    found for `ResearchRun`, which is why this mirrors
    `reconcile_stale_research_runs` rather than inventing its own shape.

    What it deliberately does NOT do, and why. It does not change
    `status`: an attempt stuck at `PENDING_CREATE` means only that AIKDAP
    never observed a successful container creation within the expected
    window -- NOT that the container is absent, NOT that Docker failed,
    NOT that the launcher crashed. Moving the row to `CREATED`/`EXITED`/

    reconciler that has actually queried the daemon can. It does not
    create an attempt, touch `attempt_number`, or return the job to
    `PENDING`: retry allocation still needs its own claim protocol (Phase
    7B.12 Part 9) and does not exist yet. This slice records what is
    known and stops.

    Idempotent by value, not by a lock or a state change. Because the row

    it on every subsequent run -- so idempotency cannot come from the
    WHERE clause the way it does for research runs, and is enforced
    explicitly instead: an attempt already carrying this exact diagnostic
    is skipped, so no UPDATE is emitted, `updated_at` does not move, and
    the message can never accumulate. Run twice, run a hundred times: the
    row after run 1 is byte-identical to the row after run N, and the
    return value drops to 0.

    Concurrency is left as a future concern, matching the precedent: two
    reconcilers racing on the same row would both write the same constant
    to the same column, which Postgres serialises harmlessly. No
    ownership or claim protocol is introduced -- there is nothing here
    worth claiming, because the operation neither consumes the row nor
    triggers anything.

    The gap this closes (Sprint 16 Phase 7B.16): Phase 7B.10's
    documented failure policy leaves a claimed job at `VALIDATING`
    forever on a guard/resolver rejection, an attempt-creation failure,
    or a crash anywhere in `prepare_approved_launch()` -- and nothing

    `reconcile_stale_pending_execution_attempts` in shape, one level up
    the same lifecycle Phase 7B.12 identified as having two independent
    clocks: a job's status and one attempt's relationship to a
    container.

    What it deliberately does NOT do, and why. It does not change
    `status`: a job stuck at `VALIDATING` proves only that AIKDAP has
    not observed it leave that state within the expected window -- NOT
    that validation failed, NOT that Docker failed, NOT that no attempt
    was ever created, NOT that the launcher crashed. Moving the row to
    `FAILED` would assert a specific one of those causes without
    evidence for it. It does not create an `ExecutionAttempt`, does not
    increment `attempt_number`, and does not return the job to
    `PENDING` -- retry allocation still needs its own claim protocol
    (Phase 7B.12 Part 9) and does not exist yet. It also never queries
    `ExecutionAttempt` at all: whether a `PENDING_CREATE` attempt
    already exists for this job is irrelevant to this function and
    reveals nothing about Docker state either way, so inspecting it
    would only invite exactly the inference this design forbids.

    Idempotent by explicit value check, not by relying on the query's
    own exclusion. `find_stale_validating_jobs` filters on
    `updated_at`, and writing `reason` here necessarily bumps
    `updated_at` too (same `onupdate=func.now()` mechanism that marks
    the original claim) -- so, incidentally, a freshly-marked row also
    stops matching the query until the threshold elapses again. That
    incidental exclusion is NOT what this function relies on for
    correctness: the explicit `reason == STALE_VALIDATING_JOB_DIAGNOSTIC`
    skip below is what actually prevents a re-write (and guards the
    same-moment concurrent-reconciler race the query's own timing
    cannot). Net effect either way: run twice within the threshold
    window, second run marks 0; a job that stays stuck long enough to
    cross the threshold again is legitimately re-selected but still
    marks 0 once re-checked, because nothing new is known.

    One documented consequence of reusing `updated_at` for both the
    detection timestamp and the diagnostic write: after this function
    marks a row, `updated_at` no longer means "time of entering
    VALIDATING" -- it means "time last reconciled". Nothing in the
    current architecture reads `updated_at` for any purpose other than
    this query, so this is an accepted, harmless consequence of not
    introducing a dedicated `validating_at` column, not an oversight.
