"""Celery tasks for the asset processing pipeline and research execution.

Celery task bodies are synchronous by design — the default `prefork`
worker pool doesn't support native `async def` tasks. Every task here
is a thin bridge that opens a fresh event loop via `asyncio.run()` to
drive the async DB/service layer for the duration of one task, then
returns. All real business logic lives in the existing processing
services (`AssetProcessingService`, `AssetRepository`,
`get_text_extractor`, `get_embedding_provider`) — nothing here
reimplements them; each task's body is a call into one.

`process_uploaded_asset` is the one actually wired up (enqueued by
`AssetService.upload` and `POST /assets/{id}/process`) and is the only
task whose failure path is "primary" — `AssetProcessingService`
records failures on the asset's own `processing_status`/
`processing_error` rather than raising, so this task's own retry
handling is a safety net for infrastructure failures, not the main
error-reporting mechanism.

`extract_document_text`, `generate_ai_metadata`, `generate_embeddings`,
and `update_processing_status` are standalone, individually invokable
steps — useful for future composition (e.g. a Celery `chain()`, or a
future Planner triggering just one phase) even though nothing calls
them yet. `generate_ai_metadata` (Sprint 9B, Qwen) and
`generate_embeddings` (Sprint 9C, BGE-M3) both run real local models
now; each shares its underlying service/provider with the inline
pipeline call in `AssetProcessingService.process_asset` rather than
reimplementing it — this file adds only the standalone-invocation
bridge.

    The single choke point every task below runs through instead of a

    rather than being repeated at each of the six call sites. The
    reset itself is `reset_litellm_logging_worker_for_task_boundary`
    in `app.core.llm.gateway` — kept there rather than here so this
    module never imports `litellm` directly, preserving the
    containment invariant `test_litellm_is_imported_only_by_the_gateway`
    checks (see that function's docstring for the full root-cause

    Sprint 16 Phase 8.0: this function calls a FRESH `asyncio.run()` for

    over its lifetime -- confirmed live, against a real worker consuming
    from a real Redis broker, that this breaks once a `pool_pre_ping`-
    backed connection pool is shared across them (`asyncpg` connections
    are bound to the loop that created them; a later task's `asyncio.
    run()` creates a new loop, and re-validating a pooled connection
    from a now-closed loop raises `RuntimeError: ... attached to a
    different loop`). An `await engine.dispose()` added here after every
    task was tried first and verified correct in an isolated repro, but
    the real worker still failed on a later task despite it -- see
    `app.database.session.configure_for_worker_process`'s own docstring
    for the full story. The actual fix lives THERE: `app.workers.worker`
    calls it before any task module is imported, rebuilding the engine
    with `NullPool` so no connection is ever held between checkouts in
    the first place -- nothing to do here as a result.
