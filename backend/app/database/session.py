    worker` before `app.workers.tasks` (or anything else that binds its
    own `from app.database.session import async_session_factory` name)
    is ever imported, since reassigning the globals here does not
    retroactively update a name another module already imported by
    value.

    Why this exists, confirmed live (not theorized) against a real
    Celery worker consuming from a real Redis broker: `app.workers.
    tasks._run_task_loop` drives every task through its OWN `asyncio.
    run()` call, and a long-lived worker process makes MANY such calls
    over its lifetime (one per task, plus one for `worker_ready`'s
    startup reconciliation) -- all sharing this ONE process-lifetime
    connection pool. `asyncpg` connections are bound to the event loop
    that created them; `asyncio.run()` closes its loop on return. An
    `await engine.dispose()` added after every `_run_task_loop` call
    (and after startup reconciliation) was tried FIRST and verified
    correct in isolation (a standalone repro script disposing between
    three sequential `asyncio.run()` calls never failed) -- but the
    real worker process, under real Celery/kombu machinery, still hit
    `RuntimeError: ... attached to a different loop` on a later task's
    very first database call, even with disposal in place. The
    isolated repro could not reproduce whatever real-worker-specific
    interaction causes a connection to survive disposal, so rather than
    continue chasing that root cause, this closes the entire class of
    bug structurally: `NullPool` never holds a connection between
    checkouts, so there is never a stale one to reuse, regardless of
    the exact mechanism. Confirmed live afterward: a Celery worker
    processing a sequence of real `launch_execution_job`/`reconcile_
    execution_attempt` tasks no longer fails on the second (or later)
    task.

    Deliberately NOT applied to the module-level default engine every
    process gets: the FastAPI/uvicorn API process runs ONE persistent
    event loop for its entire lifetime (never calls `asyncio.run()` per
    request), so pooled connection reuse there is a genuine benefit
    with no cross-loop risk -- this function only ever runs in the
    worker process.
