"""The LangGraph orchestrator: builds and compiles the research workflow.

Responsibilities are deliberately narrow — graph construction, node
registration, conditional transitions, and compilation. No agent
business logic lives here; every node comes from `AGENT_REGISTRY` and
is wrapped by `tracking.instrument` so execution tracking and the
failure policy are applied uniformly rather than reimplemented per
agent.

Topology::

    START
      -> planner
      -> router
           |-- asset_retrieval ---------------------+
           |-- web_research (no knowledge base) ----|--> context_builder
           \\---------------------------------------+
      -> context_builder
      -> synthesis
           |-- evidence insufficient, live web search configured, web not
           |   yet tried --> web_research -> context_builder -> synthesis
           \\-- otherwise --> END

External search is a fallback, not a peer source: the project's own
evidence is always tried first, and the web is consulted (at most once)
only when synthesis reports that evidence insufficient.

Retrieval agents are chained conditionally rather than fanned out in
parallel. Both are valid LangGraph, but they share a single database
session and the run's step trace is persisted in execution order —
sequencing keeps both deterministic. Fan-out remains available:
`retrieved_documents` and `intermediate_results` already carry
reducers, so parallel branches would merge correctly if a future sprint
needs the latency win.

The compiled graph holds no per-run state. Strategies, the database
session, and the execution tracker are injected per invocation through
`config["configurable"]`, so one compiled instance is safely shared
across concurrent runs.
