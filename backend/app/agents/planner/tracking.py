"""Per-node execution tracking and failure handling for the graph.

Every registered agent is wrapped by `instrument()` before it becomes a
LangGraph node. The wrapper times the call, reports start/success/
failure to an injected `NodeExecutionTracker`, and applies the failure
policy the registry declares for that agent.

Why the wrapper exists rather than tracking from outside the graph: an
exception raised inside a node surfaces from `astream`/`ainvoke` with
no indication of *which* node produced it, so a caller cannot mark the
right `research_steps` row as failed. Instrumenting each node is the
only place that knowledge exists.

This module stays free of database and HTTP concerns. The tracker is an
abstract contract; `app.modules.research.service` supplies the
implementation that writes `research_steps` and `agent_messages`, and
`NullTracker` lets the graph run untracked in unit tests.
