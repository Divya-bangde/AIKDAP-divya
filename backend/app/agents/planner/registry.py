"""Registry of the agents (graph nodes) the research workflow can run.

One place that answers "what agents exist, what does each one do, and
what happens when one fails". The orchestrator builds the graph from
this registry rather than from a hardcoded list of `add_node` calls, so
adding an agent is a registration plus its edges — not an edit to the
workflow builder.

Deliberately small: a dict of specs and two lookup helpers. There is no
plugin discovery, no dependency-injection container, and no lifecycle
protocol, because nothing in the platform needs them yet. Runtime
dependencies (the planner strategy, retrievers, the synthesizer) are
already injected per-run through the graph config; the registry only
describes *which* nodes exist and how the graph should treat them.
