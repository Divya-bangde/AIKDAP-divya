"""The Planner Agent: turns a research request into an execution plan.

`PlannerStrategy` is the abstraction point. This sprint ships one
implementation, `RuleBasedPlanner`, which is deterministic and calls no
model. It is not a stub — it performs real request classification and
produces a real, executable plan that the graph genuinely follows. A
future sprint adds an `LLMPlanner` alongside it and changes
`get_planner()`; no node, service, or route needs to change, because
they depend on the `PlannerStrategy` contract rather than on how the
plan was produced.

The plan is data, not control flow: the router reads it to decide the
route, so a different planner immediately produces different execution
without touching the graph topology.
