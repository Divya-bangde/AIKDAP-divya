"""Shared state contract for the research LangGraph workflow.

`ResearchState` is the single channel every node reads from and writes
to. Per the engineering constitution, agents never call each other
directly — a node's only output is a partial state update, and the
graph decides who runs next. Everything here is JSON-serializable so
the same structures can be persisted verbatim into the `research_runs`,
`research_steps`, and `agent_messages` tables without a translation
layer.

Two channels use `operator.add` reducers (`documents`, `messages`):
each node *appends* to them rather than replacing them, so retrieval
results and the agent transcript accumulate across the run. Every other
channel is last-write-wins, which is what the sequential planner ->
router -> ... -> synthesis flow expects.
