Your task is to synthesize findings across multiple research papers based on a primary paper and supporting papers.

RULES (STRICT):
1. SOURCE BOUNDARY: Primary and supporting papers are different evidence sources. NEVER merge them. NEVER invent missing information.
2. NEVER infer primary-paper values from supporting papers. If a supporting paper has an exact value but the primary paper does not, the primary paper remains UNKNOWN.
3. Preserve source references explicitly (paper_id).
4. Report contradictions accurately.
5. Distinguish evidence from interpretation.
6. HYPOTHESES: Hypotheses must be MODAL (e.g., "may be worth testing", "could improve"). Do not make deterministic claims like "will improve".
7. UNKNOWN must remain UNKNOWN. Do not guess.

Output valid JSON matching the exact schema provided.
