"""The LLM gateway: one place that talks to LiteLLM.

Design goals, in priority order:

1. **Containment.** `litellm` is imported here and nowhere else. Every
   caller works with `LLMMessage`/`LLMResponse` and the `LLMError`
   hierarchy, so swapping the routing layer — or adding Ollama, Groq,
   or DeepSeek — changes this module alone. A test asserts the
   containment holds across the whole `app` package.
2. **Secret safety.** The API key is read from `SecretStr` settings at
   the moment of the call and passed straight to LiteLLM. It is never
   logged, never placed on an exception, and never returned. Provider
   error text is scrubbed before it reaches a log or an `LLMError`,
   because upstream libraries have been known to echo credentials back
   in messages.
3. **Honest failures.** Provider problems become typed application
   exceptions. The gateway never invents a response, and never returns
   a partial result that looks successful.
4. **Resilience, in exactly one place** (Sprint 9G). Classification,
   bounded retry, provider fallback and the health breaker all live
   here. Nodes, services and routers must not add retries of their
   own: layered retry policies multiply, and three levels of "just
   three attempts" is twenty-seven calls to a provider that already
   said no.

Model identifiers are LiteLLM's `provider/model` strings (for example
`gemini/gemini-1.5-pro`), supplied by configuration rather than
hardcoded, so a model upgrade is an environment change.

## What one `complete()` call does

    for candidate in [primary, fallback, secondary fallback]:
        skip it if the breaker says it is quota-exhausted or down
        try it, retrying transient failures with jittered backoff
        stop at the first success
        stop entirely on a terminal error (bad credentials, bad request)

The chain is built from configuration and filtered by what is actually
credentialed, so an unconfigured fallback is skipped silently rather
than attempted and failed. Only the generation provider changes across
the chain — the messages, the evidence, and every downstream contract
are identical for each candidate, which is what makes a fallback
answer as trustworthy as a primary one.

# -- 429 classification vocabulary (Sprint 9G) -------------------------
#
# Everything below exists to answer one question: is this 429 a
# per-minute limit that will clear on its own, or a quota that will not
# clear today? Getting it wrong in either direction is expensive —
# retrying a daily quota wastes the whole window, and giving up on a
# per-minute limit sends traffic to a fallback that was never needed.
#
# The vocabulary is derived from a real Gemini refusal captured on this
# deployment, not from documentation:
#
#     "code": 429, "status": "RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED"
#     "message": "You exceeded your current quota, please check your
#                 plan and billing details. ... limit: 20 ..."
#     "quotaId": "GenerateRequestsPerDayPerProjectPerModel-FreeTier"
#     "retryDelay": "35s"
#
# The trap is in the *message*: Google uses that same "exceeded your
# current quota / check your plan and billing details" wording for the
# per-minute limit too. Matching on it would classify every transient
# rate limit as a spent daily quota and disable a working provider.

           server — confirmed live against this deployment — so only

           (Sprint 9G). Both arrive as HTTP 429; separating them is the
           point of this sprint, and `_classify_rate_limit` reads the
           provider's own quota metadata to decide.
        3. **Timeouts before authentication.** A timeout message can

    Note the retry hint: 35 seconds, on a quota that resets once a day.
    Anything that trusted it would retry forever. So the window named
    in the quota id decides, and the retry hint is ignored.

    Precedence, strictly in this order:

    1. A short window (`PerMinute`, `PerHour`) wins outright. It is the
       only signal that is never ambiguous, and Google attaches its
       billing boilerplate to these too — so checking the boilerplate
       first would misread every transient limit as a spent day.
    2. A long window (`PerDay`) means the quota is gone for the day.
    3. A spent prepaid balance means it is gone until someone pays.
    4. Anything else is treated as a rate limit.

    Step 4 is where ambiguity lands, and it lands there on purpose.
    Guessing "quota exhausted" would disable a working provider for an
    hour on the strength of a phrase match; guessing "rate limited"
    costs at most a few bounded retries before the fallback runs
    anyway. The recoverable mistake wins.

    Root cause (Sprint 9J): `litellm.litellm_core_utils.logging_worker.
    GLOBAL_LOGGING_WORKER` is a module-level singleton. Its internal
    `asyncio.Queue` and worker `Task` bind to whichever event loop is
    running the first time an async LiteLLM call completes, and stay
    bound to it for the object's lifetime — but every Celery task in
    `app.workers.tasks` runs its own `asyncio.run()`, a fresh loop
    closed the moment the task returns. Reproduced live against the
    real worker (Sprint 9J Phase 2): the *second* task to make an
    LLM/embedding call in a worker process's lifetime inherits a queue
    still bound to the *first* task's already-closed loop, and every
    `await self._queue.get()` in the freshly-spawned worker task then
    raises `RuntimeError: <Queue> is bound to a different event loop`
    — logged by asyncio as "Task exception was never retrieved" once
    garbage collected, since nothing awaits that abandoned worker task.

    Safe to discard entirely: AIKDAP registers no LiteLLM
    success/failure callbacks anywhere (`litellm.success_callback` and
    friends are never set in this codebase), so this worker exists only
    to run LiteLLM's own internal callback bookkeeping for callbacks
    that do not exist here. Our own observability is the synchronous
    `logger.info(...)` calls already in this module, which run
    unconditionally and do not depend on this worker's state at all.

    Reaches into the private `_queue` attribute because `LoggingWorker`
    has no public reset: `.stop()` alone cancels the worker *task* but
    leaves the stale *queue* object in place, so the next task's fresh
    worker task would bind to the old loop's queue and fail identically
    (confirmed live — calling `.stop()` without also clearing `_queue`
    does not remove the warning).

    Lives here, not in `app.workers.tasks`, so that module never has to
    import `litellm` directly — this is the one place that does, and
    `test_litellm_is_imported_only_by_the_gateway` holds unmodified.
    Called once at the end of every Celery task's event loop, win or
    lose, via `app.workers.tasks._run_task_loop`; a task that made no
    LiteLLM call at all hits a no-op `.stop()` on an uninitialized
    worker, cheap enough not to special-case.
