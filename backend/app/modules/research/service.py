"""Business logic for the research workspace.

Two services, split by who calls them:

- `ResearchService` — request-scoped, used by the router. Validates
  ownership, creates the run, dispatches it, and reads runs back. It
  never executes the workflow.
- `ResearchExecutionService` — worker-scoped, used by the Celery task.
  Drives the LangGraph workflow and writes the Explainable-AI trace.

Ownership is enforced transitively through the project, exactly as in
the projects/assets/tasks modules: "exists but not yours" and "doesn't
exist" both surface as `ResearchRunNotFoundError`, so ownership is
never leaked to the caller.

    The database-backed implementation of the orchestrator's tracking

    timing, and the transcript all follow one rule rather than being
    reconstructed by whoever happens to observe the graph.

    Each node produces exactly one row, moving `running -> completed`
    or `running -> failed`. The `running` row is committed before the
    node executes, which is what makes an in-flight run observable
    through `GET /research/runs/{id}`.

    No second execution-tracking table is introduced: this uses the
    existing `research_steps` and `agent_messages` models and the
