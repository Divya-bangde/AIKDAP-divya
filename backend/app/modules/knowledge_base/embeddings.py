"""Embedding provider abstraction.

Defines `EmbeddingProvider`, the interface every embedding backend
(OpenAI, NVIDIA NIM, Voyage AI, Jina AI, a local model) implements.

`GatewayEmbeddingProvider` is the real implementation, using the same
centralized `LLMGateway` (Sprint 9A) that document understanding
(Sprint 9B) already drives models through — no second HTTP client. It
is provider-agnostic: the backend is chosen by `EMBEDDING_MODEL`'s
LiteLLM provider prefix (`ollama/bge-m3` for the local BGE-M3 that
Sprint 9C shipped, `jina_ai/jina-embeddings-v3` for a hosted
deployment where no local model server exists), so no subclass or
branch is needed per provider. `NullEmbeddingProvider` remains as the
structural placeholder Sprint 6 shipped, kept for tests and for any
deployment that runs with no embedding backend configured.

Changing provider changes the vector space: stored embeddings from a
previous model stay numerically valid but are no longer comparable, so
a provider switch requires re-embedding before search is meaningful.

    Switching provider does *not* migrate existing vectors: a different
    model is a different vector space, so previously embedded chunks
    must be re-embedded before similarity search is meaningful again.

    `dimensions` is fixed to `settings.embedding_dimension` (1024,
    verified live against this deployment's model before being set as
    the default — see `settings.py`) rather than re-derived per call:
    the pgvector column width is committed at migration time, so a
