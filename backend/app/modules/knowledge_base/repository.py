"""Data-access layer for the `KnowledgeChunk` model.

Contains only persistence operations; transaction boundaries (commit)
and ownership rules live in `service.py`. The one exception is
`search_similar`: it takes `owner_id` and joins against `Project`
directly, enforcing ownership at the SQL level rather than trusting a
separate pre-check the caller could forget — a stricter guarantee than
`list_by_project`'s pattern (an explicit `project_id`, previously
validated by the caller), appropriate for a new query that can
optionally span every project a user owns.
