`get_by_id` is the operation the future launcher's Celery task body will
call with the `job_id` carried on its (minimal) Celery message (Phase
7B.7 Part 4/6) -- everything else about the job is re-fetched here, never
trusted from the message itself.

`claim_pending_job` (Phase 7B.11) is the one method here that commits its
own transaction rather than leaving that to the caller (unlike `create()`,

resolve the row lock a competing claim attempt is blocked on and so a
subsequent guard/resolver failure in the same caller's session cannot
roll the claim back out from under a concurrent observer.

        THREE statements, deliberately NOT one atomic `UPDATE ...
        WHERE ... AND NOT EXISTS (...)`. An earlier version of this
        method used exactly that single-statement form and was PROVEN
        WRONG against real concurrent Postgres (Phase 7B.21): when a
        blocked `UPDATE` unblocks after the blocking transaction
        commits, Postgres's `EvalPlanQual` re-check refetches the
        TARGET ROW's latest version, but a correlated subquery against
        a DIFFERENT table (here, `execution_attempts`) embedded in that
        same statement is NOT guaranteed a fresh snapshot -- it can
        still evaluate against the pre-block view, incorrectly finding
        `NOT EXISTS` true even though the blocking transaction just
        committed the very attempt row that should have made it false.
        Reproduced deterministically (9/10 runs, then isolated and
        confirmed 3/3 with a minimal raw-SQL probe) before this fix;
        confirmed absent (5/5) after splitting into separate statements.

        The fix: (1) `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` acquires the row lock --
        Postgres's own documented behavior for `FOR UPDATE` under
        `READ COMMITTED` is to block on a conflicting lock and, once
        acquired, return the row's LATEST committed version, not a
        stale one. (2) A SEPARATE, subsequent `SELECT EXISTS(...)`
        statement gets its own fresh `READ COMMITTED` snapshot --
        distinct from statement (1)'s snapshot -- and so correctly sees
        anything the just-unblocked transaction committed. (3) Only if
        both checks pass does the actual self-loop `UPDATE` run, still
        holding the SAME lock acquired in step 1 (never released
        between these three statements, since none of them commits or
        rolls back) -- so nothing can interleave between the checks and

        itself confirms the corresponding transition -- so `updated_at` on
        a matching row means "time this attempt was last known to make
        real progress," not merely "time the row was inserted."

        Reuses `execution_attempt_stale_after_seconds` rather than a new
        setting: every current resource class's `timeout_s` is at most 10
        seconds (`docker_policy._RESOURCE_CLASS_CONFIG`), so a genuinely
        healthy attempt always leaves `CREATED`/`RUNNING` within roughly
        that long; the existing 300-second ceiling (already sized as a
        conservative worst case for the *slower*, pre-Docker-call
        `PENDING_CREATE` span) is a wide, safe margin here too, not a
        borrowed value that happens to fit by coincidence.

        Deliberately narrow: `PENDING_CREATE` (covered by
        `find_stale_pending_attempts`) and `EXITED`/`UNKNOWN` (already
        terminal -- nothing to detect) are excluded by status regardless of
        age.
