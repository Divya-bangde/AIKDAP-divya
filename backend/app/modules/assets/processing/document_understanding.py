"""Local AI document understanding: Qwen 3.5 4B through Ollama.

Deliberately separate from `extractors.py`: that module pulls raw text
out of file bytes deterministically (no model involved), and this
module is the one place an AI model is asked to understand text that
has *already* been extracted. Qwen is never asked to recover missing
text — an empty or unextractable document never reaches this module.

Reuses `app.core.llm.get_llm_gateway()` (Sprint 9A) rather than a
second, parallel Ollama HTTP client: LiteLLM's `ollama_chat/<model>`
notation already drives Ollama through the same gateway used for
Gemini, so this module only adds document-domain concerns — the
prompt, the output schema, the chunk-if-oversized/merge strategy, and
mapping failures onto `AIProfileStatus` — not a second transport layer.
