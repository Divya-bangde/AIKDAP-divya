    extractor is implemented yet for the asset's MIME type (a known,
    expected gap), as opposed to `FAILED`, which means something broke
    while processing a MIME type we do support.

    contained zero machine-readable text — the signature of a scanned
    document. Distinct from both `UNSUPPORTED` (we don't have any
    extractor for this MIME type at all) and `FAILED` (the file didn't
    parse) — this format IS supported, this specific file just needs
    OCR, which isn't available yet.
