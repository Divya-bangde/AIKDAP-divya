#: Sprint 12.4: which declared MIME types are consistent with a given
#: extension. `validate_extension` and `validate_mime_type` each check
#: their own value is *individually* allowed, but neither checked that
#: the two *agree* -- a `.pdf`-named file declaring `text/plain` (or
#: any other individually-allowed pair) passed both checks and was then
#: routed to the wrong extractor by MIME type, since dispatch
#: (`get_text_extractor`) trusts `mime_type` alone. Confirmed
#: exploitable: a real 277KB production PDF decoded as UTF-8 text
#: produces mostly-printable PDF syntax (only ~0.3% control/replacement
#: characters for a small uncompressed sample, ~53% for a real
#: compressed one) that `PlainTextExtractor` would have accepted as
#: genuine content with no error at all before this sprint's
#: `_looks_like_binary_garbage` gate (see extractors.py) existed as a
#: second line of defense.
#:
#: Several extensions intentionally accept more than one MIME type:
#: real browsers/OSes are inconsistent about what they declare for
#: `.md`/`.csv`/`.json` (Windows commonly sends `text/plain` for all
#: three), so being stricter here would reject legitimate uploads this
#: sprint has no evidence justifies rejecting.
